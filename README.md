PART 1
this is my second and (hopefully) final repo for the java portion of the LCA Part 1 assignment. find my initial submissions at https://github.com/femurray/SoftwareEngineering
the reason for 2 repos is i was trying to figure out linking github to eclipse

the python portion is found at https://github.com/femurray/LowestCommonAncestorPython


PART 2
This repo now also includes LCA Part 2 assignment involving DAG.
Created new classes DAG and DAGTest because previous implementation of LCA did not work for DAG whatsoever
